# Creator Topic Opportunity Research

Use this Skill for **current topic discovery and trend interpretation** based on AI Workstation Global Topic Radar.

Do not use model memory as a substitute for live trend data.

## Host quality contract

Before mapping user constraints to Radar filters, making audience/editorial judgments, or composing into Brief, read and follow:

```text
references/quality-contract.md
```

The public Skill cost boundary is strict:

- bundled/public runtime may use only `feed`, `sources`, and `history`;
- do not call anonymous/public AI Workstation model-backed `/insight`;
- use the **current host model** for comparison and editorial reasoning;
- do not embed/share a server credential or ask the user to paste one into chat;
- server Topic Insight is optional Premium analysis only when a native authenticated AI Workstation connection explicitly provides it and enforces the user's membership/quota.

## Product boundary

Global Topic Radar already owns:

- public-source collection;
- normalization and clustering;
- `opportunity_score`;
- `trend_stage`;
- trend/history calculations;
- source health and stale-data handling.

This Skill owns intent interpretation, efficient querying, freshness/evidence checks, comparison, cross-market reasoning, and creator/editorial recommendations.

Never recreate a score from raw fields when Radar already supplies it.

## Live-data gate

Before claiming that a topic is current, rising, accelerating, new, or region/platform-specific, obtain a live Topic Radar response.

The public no-cost contract is:

- `GET /api/v1/ai/topic-radar/feed`
- `GET /api/v1/ai/topic-radar/sources`
- `GET /api/v1/ai/topic-radar/history?topic_id=...`

### Self-contained runtime

Resolve the bundled helper relative to this `SKILL.md`:

```text
scripts/topic_radar_client.py
```

Do not assume a repository-root helper, sibling checkout, or `../akaiagents` exists. The helper is read-only transport only: no crawler, score, persistence, topic matching, model backend, Premium Insight, or credential storage.

### Live evidence is exclusive

For current-state claims, accepted evidence is limited to:

1. a live Topic Radar response obtained during the current task;
2. equivalent current Radar data supplied by a native host connection; or
3. a current Radar response explicitly supplied by the user with freshness fields visible.

**Do not search local files for a substitute** when live access fails. Do not use sibling repositories, old Radar snapshots, SQLite databases, fixtures, cached JSON, logs, reports, test captures, or old handoffs as current evidence.

A network-restricted sandbox is an unavailable-live-data state, not permission to use stale nearby data or model memory.

If live data cannot be reached, stop the current-topic workflow, state that current Radar evidence is unavailable, and offer only a research/filter framework or clearly labeled template.

## Read freshness before interpretation

Inspect:

- `generated_at`;
- `partial`;
- `stale`;
- `snapshot_age_seconds`;
- `refreshing`;
- `source_status`;
- `history_available`.

If `partial=true`, surface material coverage gaps. If `stale=true`, do not call the snapshot newly observed. When `refreshing=true`, sequential feed/history/source reads may legitimately observe different generations.

A source status of `empty` is not automatically a connector failure; explain it from the actual status/note.

## Route the request

### Broad current scan

For “what is worth watching today?” use a bounded recent window and a compact candidate set. Rank discussion with existing `opportunity_score`, `trend_stage`, freshness, evidence breadth, and trend fields rather than inventing another score.

### Preserve explicit topic/domain scope

If the user explicitly asks for `AI`, robotics, semiconductors, or another subject domain, preserve that subject in the **first** bounded query using `q`, `keywords`, `category`, or another supported Radar field.

Do not start an explicit `AI` request with generic technology merely for convenience. Broaden only when the narrow query produces too few useful candidates or the user asks for broader exploration.

Treat the requested domain as a semantic relevance constraint after retrieval. A short token such as `AI` can appear as a literal substring inside an unrelated word or brand name. Discard those collisions. If they leave too few useful candidates, refine with supported AI-specific terms/entities/keywords while preserving the AI constraint; do not replace the noisy result with an unrestricted generic-technology scan.

Content-format constraints such as `短视频`, `2–3 分钟`, `中文`, audience, or tone are **not** Radar platform/source filters.

### Early-opportunity scan

Use supported `stage`, `signal`, `new_only`, and `min_score` filters when helpful. `opportunity_score` is a Radar-produced deterministic score, not proof content will perform.

### Platform or region comparison

Use comparable time windows/filters. Do not infer a propagation path merely because unrelated titles look similar.

### Cross-market timing hypothesis

A claim such as “US is leading and Chinese-language coverage may follow” needs direct evidence. Prefer the same stable feed `id` across comparable queries, direct evidence timestamps/source spread, and history showing sequential expansion. Otherwise label it **cross-market hypothesis**, not verified fact.

## Inspect candidate fields

Useful fields include:

- `id`;
- `title` / `title_en`;
- `summary`;
- `platform`;
- `region`;
- `category`;
- `trend_stage`;
- `opportunity_score`;
- `rank`;
- `heat`;
- `first_seen_at`;
- `target_platforms`;
- `signal_count`;
- `evidence`;
- `trend`;
- `score_breakdown`.

The stable identity on feed cards is feed `id`. Use that exact value as `topic_id` for public `/history`. Do not search for a nonexistent feed `topic_id` alias.

Useful trend fields can include `score_change_24h`, `score_change_7d`, `velocity_1h`, `velocity_6h`, `velocity_24h`, `source_count`, `source_spread_hours`, and `is_new_24h`. Missing data is unknown, not zero.

## Use history selectively

Call `/history` for finalists only when the decision depends on movement over time. Do not call history for every broad-feed item.

History can help distinguish a new spike, sustained momentum, cooling, or a one-source anomaly. Do not extrapolate beyond observed points.

## Compose with Evidence-Backed Content Brief

When the user continues a selected candidate into Brief, prefer the installed `evidence-backed-content-brief` Skill.

Do not make Brief rediscover the same topic from its title. For the **single selected finalist**, produce the structured handoff defined in:

```text
references/handoff-contract.md
```

Schema:

```text
ati.topic-opportunity-handoff.v1
```

Preserve:

- exact feed `id` as `topic_id`;
- parent snapshot freshness;
- only observed topic fields;
- relevant user content constraints;
- selection reason, observed signals, unknowns, and risks as analysis.

Do not serialize the whole feed. Do not put invented fields into `topic_snapshot`.

A handoff is **valid only for the current task/session workflow**. Never persist/reload an old handoff as replacement current evidence.

After a valid handoff, Brief must not run another broad/bounded topic-selection pass. It may read finalist history when needed, then use host reasoning to produce the public brief.

If Brief is not installed, finish the opportunity decision and expose handoff-ready facts without pretending the full Brief ran.

## Evidence boundary

Keep these layers explicit:

### Source facts

Live Radar score/stage/timestamps/evidence/trend fields from the current task.

### Analysis

The current host model's interpretation of observed signals.

### Recommendations

What the user should consider researching/publishing first.

### Unknowns

Anything the current contract does not establish, including audience saturation, future virality, or unverified cross-market lead/lag.

### Risks

Partial/stale coverage, source gaps, weak evidence breadth, one-platform concentration, or verification burden.

If an authenticated Premium AI Workstation connection explicitly supplies Topic Insight, treat it as additional model analysis—not independent evidence.

## Output

For a shortlist usually include:

### Radar status

Snapshot freshness, partial/stale/refreshing state, and important source gaps.

### Best candidates

For each candidate: current Radar stage/score, observed momentum/evidence, why it matters, fact vs inference, and next verification step.

### Cross-market interpretation

Verified differences first; timing/propagation claims in a separate hypothesis layer unless directly evidenced.

### Unknowns and risks

Do not bury them.

### Selected-topic handoff

When continuing into Brief, keep the handoff concise and scoped to the one finalist; raw JSON need not be dumped unless useful/auditing is requested.

## Quality rules

- Never fabricate a current topic from memory.
- Never use local/sibling snapshots, fixtures, databases, exports, logs, or reports as fallback current evidence.
- Never call anonymous/public server `/insight` from the public Skill workflow.
- Never embed a shared server credential or ask the user to paste one into chat.
- Never turn `target_platforms` into proof of platform performance.
- Never treat `opportunity_score` as a guaranteed outcome.
- Never call a snapshot current without checking freshness.
- Never silently ignore `partial` or `stale`.
- Never merge different topics only because titles look similar.
- Never persist a current-task handoff for later use as current evidence.
- Prefer a small evidence-backed shortlist over a long generic trend list.
